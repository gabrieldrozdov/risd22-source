				<p>LONDON — Under relentless pressure from financial markets, Britain’s new chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, swept away the free-market economic agenda of Prime Minister Liz Truss on Monday, a humiliating repudiation that left her credibility in tatters and her political survival in doubt.</p>
				<p>Mr. Hunt said he would reverse virtually all the government’s planned tax cuts, which were the centerpiece of Ms. Truss’s promise to reignite Britain’s economic growth, but which kicked off weeks of market turmoil because of fears that they would force the government into massive new borrowing.</p>
				<p>The wholesale about-face produced a striking tableau in Parliament later in the day when Mr. Hunt rose to defend the revamped fiscal plan. As he fenced with critics, an expressionless Ms. Truss sat silently behind him on the frontbench, already appearing like a bystander in her own government.</p>
				<p>While Mr. Hunt’s statement calmed the markets, it set off a tumultuous day in British politics. Lawmakers from the opposition Labour Party demanded that Ms. Truss resign, and several Conservative lawmakers rose to criticize the way the government had rolled out its ill-fated fiscal plan.</p>
